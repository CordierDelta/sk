# Sk

Sk is _the lightest weight_ framework in the world for building responsive sites and web apps.

Based off of [Skel](https://github.com/ajlkn/skel), which is bloated af. 

**Sk: Only What You Need, None Of What You Don'tâ„¢**

- Minified production version: [`dist/sk.min.css`](dist/sk.min.css)
- Development (unminified) version: [`dist/sk.css`](dist/sk.css)

## Modules

Why would you want modules? Modules are a code smell. Bloat.
